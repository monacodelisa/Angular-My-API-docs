    <p>Hello there,</p>
    <p>You've stumbled upon my demo site, where I'm excited to showcase a collection of fake data generated by a REST
      API I developed using Node.js and Express. </p>
    <p>Before you start exploring, I want to make it clear that all the information you see here is entirely fictional.
      This site serves as a testing and prototyping tool for web development, showcasing not only the possibilities of
      web applications but also my skills in REST API development.</p>
    <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Visualized Responses:</span> Experience a dynamic visual representation of the responses that users would
        encounter when interacting with the API endpoints. Each endpoint is thoughtfully presented in the side
        navigation menu.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>About the Technology</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Frontend:</span> On the frontend, I've utilized Angular v17, a powerful framework that enhances the user
        experience and seamlessly interacts with the RESTful API.</li>
      <li><span>RESTful API:</span> My API adheres to the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), offering
        a straightforward and efficient way to interact with the server.</li>
      <li><span>Backend:</span> The backend of this demo site is powered by Node.js and Expressâ€”industry-leading
        technologies for building scalable and robust server-side applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <small>p.s. I have deliberately designed this website to look like it was designed by a backend developer <br>(I am a fullstack developer so I'm half-way there).</small>
